For the **In-App Notification** line, you can specify any of the following, depending on which app or enterprise platform is being used for official communication:

- The **official username/handle** you use on the relevant business platform or internal system (e.g., "xboxteejaymcfarmer" for some systems)
- The **user ID** assigned to you by your business’s internal notification system or enterprise app
- The **full legal name** if there is no special handle, or simply state "Not Applicable" if no in-app notification channel is used

**If you’re unsure or if no app is required:**
You can write:
**In-App:** Not Applicable

Or, if you use a standard username for business systems, use:

Let me know which feels most appropriate, or tell me the platform you use for internal notifications (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, a company portal), and I’ll format it for you!
