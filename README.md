## Key Features

### Retail Management Features
- **Strict Age Restriction Enforcement (21+ Only)**
  - Restricted categories: alcohol, tobacco (cigarettes, cigars, vaping), accessories (lighters), lottery tickets.
  - Automated ID scanning (OCR), manual override, and transaction blocking for non-compliance.
  - Comprehensive audit trail: logs customer age, verification method, employee ID, and timestamp.

- **Dynamic Pricing Engine**
  - Fuel prices adjust automatically using GasBuddy competitor feeds and Arizona state tax rates.

- **Inventory Automation**
  - Low stock detection and automated ordering via Coremark API.

- **Fuel Sensor Calibration**
  - Monitors and recalibrates Veeder-Root fuel sensors if drift exceeds 0.5%.

- **FDA Compliance Signage**
  - Auto-generates signage for tobacco sales per compliance.

### Crypto Payment Features
- **Tokenless, seamless crypto payments** facilitated by AI chats eliminating wallet complexity for end users.
- **Nanoswarm decentralized network** enabling ultra-low latency and invisible transaction propagation.
- **Distributed ledger and audit logging** guaranteeing compliance and traceability.
- **AI-powered KYC verification and transaction approval** integrated directly in the payment flow.
- **Dynamic currency conversion** handling fiat to crypto seamlessly.

## Appendix: Age Restriction Policy
A strict zero-tolerance policy is enforced for sales of alcohol, tobacco, accessories (such as lighters), and lottery products to individuals under 21. Compliance is automated in the ALN script above, ensuring persistent adherence to local and federal regulations.

## Appendix: Crypto Payment Flow
User: "I want to make a payment to merchant123 for $50."
AI Chat: "Sure, please confirm your user ID."
User: "My user ID is user456."
AI Chat: "Thank you. Processing payment of $50 to merchant123."

### Background Processing Steps:
1. Calculate the payment amount (since data volume isn't specified, it defaults to $50).
2. Verify KYC status for user456 to ensure compliance.
3. Convert $50 USD to FET cryptocurrency (assuming exchange rate 1 FET = $0.1, so 500 FET).
4. Check user456's wallet balance to confirm availability of at least 500 FET.
5. Broadcast the payment transaction using the nanoswarm network for fast, invisible, and secure processing.
6. Record the transaction on a distributed ledger, ensuring transparency and immutability.
7. Log detailed transaction metrics for analytics and compliance auditing.

AI Chat: "Payment successful! Your transaction hash is abc123. Thank you for using our service."
